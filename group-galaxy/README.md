# Galaxy Ecosystem Working Group

The Galaxy Ecosystem Working Group focuses on delivering software to enable and enhance the development, management and sharing of Ansible content.

This Working Group covers multiple projects related to this stated purpose.

* [Galaxy](https://github.com/ansible/galaxy) - The code behind https:/galaxy.ansible.com/, a hub to make it easier to find and share Ansible content.
* [Mazer](https://github.com/ansible/mazer) - an experimental Ansible Galaxy content manager.

## Meetings

There are currently no regular meetings held. The ansible-galaxy IRC channel is the main and official place to contact the members. For specific issues and
feature requests, follow the standard Ansible issues/PRs workflow.

## Collaboration

Apart from IRC, the Galaxy Working Group collaborates via tickets and pull requests in the appropriate project repository.
