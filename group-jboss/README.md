# JBoss Working Group

This group's purpose is to review, coordinate, and suppot work on Ansible as it relates to JBoss-related technologies 
(JBoss AS, Wildlfy, Infinispan, etc.). Initial goals would be to expand the deployment capabilities of the current 
JBoss module, and next steps would be either to expand the module to support the full range of JBoss management 
capabilities or develop other modules to do the same.
