# Container Working Group

Focuses on supporting containers & containerized workloads. It also includes
the [ansible-container](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-container) team.

## Meetings
* Weekly on Mondays at [16:00 UTC](http://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=16:00&tz=UTC)
* [Meeting agenda](https://github.com/ansible/community/issues?q=is:open+label:meeting_agenda+label:container)

## Collaboration

* For Ansible work, we coordinate through issues and pull requests as much as
    possible. If you'd like to discuss an idea or concept, join
    the #ansible-container IRC channel.
* [Community wiki](https://github.com/ansible/community/wiki/Container) is
    currently empty, but has been created if we find something we can't cover
    with issues/PRs/IRC.
