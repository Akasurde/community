# THIS IS FOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE ANSIBLE COMMUNITY WORKING GROUP.
(link to readme.md above)

General information and guidelines for contributing to the Ansible community, including this Working Group, can be found here: http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/community/index.html

## Issues
We use Github issues to [receive](https://github.com/ansible/community/issues/new) and [track](https://github.com/ansible/community/issues) work items and requests for the Ansible Community Working Group.

## Workflow and backlog
[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/ansible/community.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](https://waffle.io/ansible/community)
We use the [Ansible/communty Waffleboard](https://waffle.io/ansible/community) as a way to visualize our backlog and progress in a Kanban-style Waffleboard. While you are not required to use [waffle.io](https://waffle.io) to participate, it does provide an easy way to view the work currently in progress, as well as issues available to "adopt."

## Pull Requests
This repository accepts PRs for things that are, or should be, in this repository.

We don't really have a "release process" for this repository, and thus, we don't have any information about how we do releases, or expanded information about why we picked one git management philosophy over another.
