# Ansible Sprints

## Goals
The main goals for a Sprint are:

- Close as many issues and PRs as possible in a timely fashion
- Get more people involved in the process and grow the community
- Create better standards while doing
- Increase common sense of achievement and improve team collaboration

## Working
The Sprint works like this:

1. Everyone joins IRC (or rather use BlueJeans instead !)
2. We quickly synchronize on methodology and goals
3. Either individually or in group, items on the list are taken (add your name to it)
4. Discuss when question are raised, improve standard documentation at the same time
5. When you close the item, strike it. Otherwise, append a small status indication when you move on
6. At the end, we celebrate our achievement !

## Preparations
Preparations include:

- Announce the Sprint widely (mailing list, agenda, IRC, Twitter, ...)
- Update all tickets so the original reporters (or bystanders) can join the Sprint
- Everyone buys alcoholic beverages and snacks of their choice for the celebration :-)

## Best practices
The following tips may be useful:

- A working teleconferencing system is very valuable, BlueJeans may work well, but if you end up needing BlueJeans chat or irc for communication because it breaks down, efficiency quickly goes down the drain
- Ensure you have prepared infrastructure to collaborate on issues in group by sharing screen
- Start your sprint with the issues from people present in the sprint, ask around if unsure !
- A good selection of things to work on is important, try to avoid `needs_contributor` or `needs_info`

## Working Group sprints
Currently the following Working Groups organize regular sprints:
